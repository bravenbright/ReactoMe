# ReactoMe
This is compilation and play by play documentation of common practice and rules for React to enable more efficient creation of react applications for all 

###As a newb

When I started there are alot of things that people learn over time as ways to do things. I didn't go to college or have a fancy job to teach me yet. So now I'm learning things on the fly with my new company ModularSystems(insert advert plug here, lol). What this will be is a comprehensive breakdown of react component common practice in more plain terms that make sense to me to refer to in the future and also for someone else to use 

Some example questions is where do i put my browser router. what is react-router. 

Also relevant now that npx is deprecated as ish or will be soo.

Some options for creating a react project. Maybe there's only vite but I'll figure that out and let you know. As it currently stands i'm using vite so maybe some vite rules in here too. 

I'll walk you through creating your react app and getting the SPA on the ground. In the steps as I perform them through markdown files. 

Let's go my fellow codeheads.
